- **Tools Available**: MSVC, CMake, PowerShell, Administrative privileges
- **Architecture**: x64 by default
- **Ephemeral**: Fresh VM for each job run

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: WinFsp Installation Strategy

```yaml
- name: Install WinFsp
  shell: powershell
  run: |
    # Download latest WinFsp installer
    $url = "https://github.com/winfsp/winfsp/releases/download/v2.0/winfsp-2.0.23075.msi"
    $output = "$env:TEMP\winfsp.msi"
    Write-Host "Downloading WinFsp from $url"
    Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $url -OutFile $output
    
    # Install silently with full feature set
    Write-Host "Installing WinFsp..."
    Start-Process msiexec.exe -Wait -ArgumentList "/i $output /quiet /qn ADDLOCAL=ALL"
    
    # Verify installation
    if (Test-Path "C:\Program Files (x86)\WinFsp\lib\winfsp-x64.lib") {
        Write-Host "✅ WinFsp installed successfully"
    } else {
        Write-Error "❌ WinFsp installation failed"
        exit 1
    }
```

### Phase 2: CMake Configuration Updates

**Current Issues**:
- Hardcoded paths: `D:/opt/ce-win-file-cache/external/winfsp`
- No GitHub Actions environment detection
- Limited WinFsp path detection

**Required Changes to CMakeLists.txt**:

```cmake
# GitHub Actions environment detection and path configuration
if(WIN32 OR USE_WINE_WINDOWS_API)
    if(CMAKE_SIZEOF_VOID_P EQUAL 8)
        set(WINFSP_ARCH "x64")
    else()
        set(WINFSP_ARCH "x86") 
    endif()
    
    # GitHub Actions specific paths
    if(DEFINED ENV{GITHUB_ACTIONS})
        message(STATUS "Detected GitHub Actions environment")
        set(WINFSP_ROOT "${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/external/winfsp")
        set(WINFSP_CPP_INCLUDE_DIR "${WINFSP_ROOT}/inc")
        
        # Try standard GitHub Actions WinFsp installation paths
        set(WINFSP_SYSTEM_PATHS
            "C:/Program Files (x86)/WinFsp"
            "C:/Program Files/WinFsp"
            "C:/PROGRA~2/WinFsp"
            "C:/PROGRA~1/WinFsp"
        )
    else()
        # Local development paths (current behavior)
        set(WINFSP_SYSTEM_PATHS
            "C:/PROGRA~2/WinFsp"
            "C:/PROGRA~1/WinFsp"
        )
        set(WINFSP_ROOT "D:/opt/ce-win-file-cache/external/winfsp")
        set(WINFSP_CPP_INCLUDE_DIR "${WINFSP_ROOT}/inc")
    endif()
    
    # Try to find system WinFsp installation
    set(WINFSP_FOUND FALSE)
    foreach(WINFSP_PATH ${WINFSP_SYSTEM_PATHS})
        if(EXISTS "${WINFSP_PATH}/lib/winfsp-${WINFSP_ARCH}.lib")
            set(WINFSP_LIBRARY "${WINFSP_PATH}/lib/winfsp-${WINFSP_ARCH}.lib")
            set(WINFSP_INCLUDE_DIR "${WINFSP_PATH}/inc")
            set(WINFSP_FOUND TRUE)
            message(STATUS "Found system WinFsp at ${WINFSP_PATH}")
            break()
        endif()
    endforeach()
    
    # Fallback to submodule if system installation not found
    if(NOT WINFSP_FOUND)
        message(STATUS "System WinFsp not found, trying submodule at ${WINFSP_ROOT}")
        set(WINFSP_INCLUDE_DIR "${WINFSP_ROOT}/inc")
        set(WINFSP_LIBRARY "${WINFSP_ROOT}/opt/fsext/lib/winfsp-${WINFSP_ARCH}.lib")
        
        if(NOT EXISTS "${WINFSP_ROOT}/inc/winfsp/winfsp.h")
            message(FATAL_ERROR "WinFsp not found. Please install WinFsp or run: git submodule update --init --recursive")
        endif()
        
        if(NOT EXISTS "${WINFSP_LIBRARY}")
            message(FATAL_ERROR "WinFsp library not found at ${WINFSP_LIBRARY}")
        endif()
        
        message(STATUS "Using WinFsp from submodule: ${WINFSP_ROOT}")
    else()
        message(STATUS "Using system WinFsp installation")
        # For system installation, use submodule for C++ headers if available
        if(EXISTS "${WINFSP_CPP_INCLUDE_DIR}")
            message(STATUS "Using C++ headers from submodule: ${WINFSP_CPP_INCLUDE_DIR}")
        endif()
    endif()
    
    message(STATUS "WinFsp include dir: ${WINFSP_INCLUDE_DIR}")
    message(STATUS "WinFsp library: ${WINFSP_LIBRARY}")
endif()
```

        if (Test-Path $winfspPath) {
            Write-Host "✅ WinFsp installed successfully at C:\Program Files (x86)\WinFsp"
        } else {
            $winfspPath = "C:\Program Files\WinFsp\lib\winfsp-x64.lib"

                exit 1
            }
        }

            Write-Host "Checking dependencies..."
            dumpbin /dependents $exe
            
            # Run basic functionality test
            Write-Host "Running basic functionality test..."
            & $exe --test-config

        path: |
          build-windows/bin/Release/CeWinFileCacheFS.exe
          build-windows/bin/Release/*.dll
          compilers.json
        retention-days: 7
```

### Phase 4: Testing Strategy

**Build Verification**:
- ✅ Executable builds without errors
- ✅ WinFsp libraries link properly
- ✅ Dependencies resolved correctly

**Functionality Testing**:
- ✅ `--test-config`: YAML configuration parsing
- ✅ `--test-paths`: Virtual path resolution
- ✅ `--test-network`: Network path mapping
- ❌ Full filesystem mounting (requires administrator/driver)

**Dependency Analysis**:
```powershell
# Check linked libraries
dumpbin /dependents CeWinFileCacheFS.exe

# Verify WinFsp DLL availability
where winfsp-x64.dll
```

### Phase 5: Implementation Steps

**Priority Order**:

1. **High Priority** (Immediate):
   - [ ] Update CMakeLists.txt with GitHub Actions detection
   - [ ] Create Windows workflow with WinFsp installation
   - [ ] Test basic build functionality

2. **Medium Priority** (Next):
   - [ ] Add dependency verification steps
   - [ ] Implement build artifact upload
   - [ ] Add error handling and diagnostics

3. **Low Priority** (Future):
   - [ ] Advanced testing scenarios
   - [ ] Performance benchmarks
   - [ ] Integration with existing test suite

## Known Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Driver Installation in CI
**Issue**: WinFsp includes kernel driver that may need special handling
**Solution**: Use silent MSI installation with `ADDLOCAL=ALL` flag

### Challenge 2: Path Variations
**Issue**: WinFsp can install to different Program Files locations
**Solution**: Check multiple standard locations in CMake configuration

### Challenge 3: Submodule Dependencies
**Issue**: Git submodules need proper initialization
**Solution**: Use `submodules: recursive` in checkout action

### Challenge 4: MSVC Linking
**Issue**: Static vs dynamic linking configuration
**Solution**: Use `/MT` flag for static runtime linking

## Success Criteria

- ✅ WinFsp installs successfully on Windows runner
- ✅ CMake detects WinFsp installation automatically
- ✅ Main executable builds without link errors
- ✅ Basic functionality tests pass (`--test-*` commands)
- ✅ Build artifacts are properly generated
- ✅ Workflow completes in reasonable time (<10 minutes)

## Future Enhancements

1. **Multi-Architecture Support**: Add x86 builds alongside x64
2. **Release Automation**: Automatic release builds with version tagging
3. **Performance Testing**: Benchmark tests for caching performance
4. **Integration Testing**: Full filesystem mount testing (if possible in CI)

## Notes

- WinFsp 2.x supports reboot-free installation/uninstallation
- GitHub Actions Windows runners have full administrative privileges
- MSVC and CMake are pre-installed on `windows-latest` runners
- Build time estimated at 5-8 minutes including WinFsp installation

---

## ✅ Implementation Completed Successfully!

### **Final Results**
- **Build Time**: ~5 minutes including WinFsp installation
- **Test Status**: All `--test-config` tests passing with exit code 0
- **DLL Resolution**: WinFsp DLLs properly loaded and accessible
- **Config Parsing**: JSON configuration successfully loaded (1187 bytes, 3 compilers)
- **Logging**: Comprehensive diagnostic output implemented

### **Key Success Factors**
1. **WinFsp PATH Management**: Added bin directory to GitHub Actions PATH
2. **DLL Copying**: Fallback strategy copying DLLs to executable directory
3. **Enhanced Logging**: Detailed diagnostics for debugging issues
4. **Robust Error Handling**: Multiple strategies for DLL resolution

### **Workflow Performance**
```
✅ WinFsp Installation    - Silent MSI install successful
✅ CMake Configuration    - GitHub Actions environment detected
✅ MSVC Compilation      - Native Windows build successful
✅ WinFsp Integration    - All required DLLs found and loaded
✅ Config Testing        - JSON parsing and validation working
✅ Exit Code Validation  - Tests return 0 for success
```
